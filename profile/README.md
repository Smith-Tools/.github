## ⚡️ The process of developing for Apple platforms optimized for agentic programming

Smith Tools is more than a CLI—it's an **intelligent ecosystem** that pairs with your AI agents to enforce architectural discipline, synthesize knowledge, and accelerate builds. We provide the "Architecture Police" and "Pattern Oracle" that modern Swift teams need.

## 🌟 Core Pillars

### 1. 🛡️ Smith: The Enforcer
**"Is this code correct?"**
Smith is your uncompromising architectural guardian. It integrates with your build pipeline to catch anti-patterns before they merge.
- **Unified Analysis**: One CLI (`smith`) for Xcode, SPM, and Swift builds.
- **TCA Validation**: Strict enforcement of The Composable Architecture rules (1.1-1.5).
- **Build Diagnostics**: Detects hangs across Xcode and Swift builds instantly.

### 2. 🧠 Maxwell: The Oracle
**"How should I build this?"**
Maxwell is the knowledge engine that powers decision-making. It doesn't just search; it synthesizes.
- **Pattern Library**: Over 122 curated architectural patterns (TCA, SwiftUI, Navigation).
- **Proactive Guidance**: automatically suggests best practices during implementation.
- **Zero-Latency**: Instant access to a vast, local knowledge base.

### 3. 🍏 Sosumi: The Librarian
**"What does Apple say?"**
Instant, offline-first access to the entire history of Apple engineering wisdom.
- **Instant Search**: Access thousands of WWDC sessions and documentation pages.
- **Offline-First**: Comprehensive local database for zero-latency lookups.
- **Agent-Optimized**: Transcripts and summaries formatted specifically for AI consumption.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Get the entire secure ecosystem in one command:

```bash
# Install Smith, Maxwell, Sosumi, and all skills
bash install-smith-tools-unified.sh
```

### Try the Agentic Workflow

**Teacher (Maxwell)** -> **Builder (You)** -> **Police (Smith)**

```bash
# 1. Ask Maxwell for the best pattern
@maxwell "How do I structure a feature with 3 child reducers?"

# 2. Implement the code...

# 3. Ask Smith to validate your work
@smith validate --tca
```

## 🆕 Recent Developments

### v4.0: The Intelligence Era

We've rebuilt the core to be faster, smarter, and more secure.

- **Unified Intelligence Engine**: A new, consolidated CLI (`smith`) now orchestrates all analysis, replacing disconnected tools.
- **Enhanced Knowledge System**: Maxwell's pattern recognition has been significantly upgraded with a unified architecture database.
- **Secure Archive Access**: We've completely overhauled how we handle offline documentation, prioritizing security and speed for our massive WWDC transcript archive.
- **Progressive Validation**: Smith's validation engine now runs in three modes—Validating, Diagnosing, or Optimizing—adapting to your current task.
